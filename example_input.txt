A now almost 4-year-old female diagnosed with KMT2A-rearranged AML and CNS2 involvement exhibited refractory disease after NOPHO DBH AML 2012 protocol. Post- MEC and ADE, MRD remained at 35% and 53%. Vyxeos-clofarabine therapy reduced MRD to 18%. Third-line FLAG-Mylotarg lowered MRD to 3.5% (flow) and 1% (molecular). After a cord blood HSCT in December 2022, she relapsed 10 months later with 3% MRD and femoral extramedullary disease.
After the iLTB discussion, in November 2023 the patient was enrolled in the SNDX5613 trial, receiving revumenib for three months, leading to a reduction in KMT2A MRD to 0.1% by PCR. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second allogeneic HSCT using cord blood with treosulfan, thiotepa, and fludarabine conditioning, followed by revumenib maintenance. In August 2024, 6.5 months after the second HSCT, the patient experienced a bone marrow relapse with 33% blasts. The patient is currently in very good clinical condition.

Diagnostic tests:

WES and RNAseq were performed on the 1st relapse sample showing KMT2A::MLLT3 fusion and NRAS (p.Gln61Lys) mutation.

Flow cytometry from the current relapse showed positive CD33 and CD123.

WES and RNAseq of the current relapse sample is pending.
